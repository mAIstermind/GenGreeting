## 3. Getting Started: A Step-by-Step Guide

The application has two main tabs for generating images. Let's explore both.

### 3.1. Generating Cards in Bulk ("Batch Generate via CSV")

This is the perfect tool for creating personalized cards for your entire contact list at once.

**Step 1: Prepare Your CSV File**
Create a CSV file with at least two columns: one for names and one for emails. The column headers can be anything (e.g., "Full Name", "Email Address").

**Step 2: Upload Your File**
On the "Batch Generate via CSV" tab, click the upload area or drag-and-drop your prepared CSV file into it.

**Step 3: Map Your Columns**
The app will ask you to confirm which column contains the names and which contains the emails.
*   Under **Contact Name**, select the column from your file that holds the names.
*   Under **Contact Email**, select the column for email addresses.

**Step 4: Choose a Style**
Select a prompt template for your cards. This determines the visual theme and style of the images the AI will generate. You can see a preview of the prompt text below your selection.

**Step 5: Generate & Download**
Click **"Confirm & Proceed"**. The application will begin generating a unique card for each person in your list. Once finished, you can:
*   Download cards one by one using the "Download" button on each card.
*   **(Pro Feature)** Click **"Download All (.zip)"** to save all cards, with your branding applied, in a single file.

### 3.2. Generating a Single Image ("Generate with Imagen")

Use this tab when you only need one high-quality image.

**Step 1: Write Your Prompt**
In the text box, describe the image you want to create. Be as descriptive as possible! For example: *"A photorealistic image of a golden retriever wearing sunglasses on a beach."*

**Step 2: Generate**
Click the **"Generate"** button. The AI will create your image and display it below.

### 3.3. Editing Your Cards

After generating a card (either in batch or individually), you can fine-tune it.

1.  Hover over any card image and click the **"Edit"** button.
2.  A new window will appear. In the text box, type your edit instruction (e.g., *"Make the background blue"* or *"Add a Santa hat"*).
3.  Click **"Apply Edit"** to see the changes. You can apply multiple edits.
4.  Once you're happy, click **"Save Changes"**.

### 3.4. Using Custom Branding (Pro Feature)

If you have a Pro account, you can add a professional watermark to your cards.

1.  Click the **"Branding"** button in the top-right corner of the application.
2.  In the settings window, enter your name or your business's name.
3.  Upload your logo (PNG, JPG, or WEBP files are supported).
4.  Click **"Save Settings"**.

Your branding will now be automatically applied to the corner of every card when you use the **"Download All (.zip)"** function.

## 4. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Q: Is there a limit to how many contacts I can upload?**
A: In the free trial, you can generate up to 10 cards in total. Paid plans offer a significantly higher number of generations per month.

**Q: What happens if an image fails to generate for one of my contacts?**
A: The app will skip that contact and continue with the rest of your list. An error message will appear explaining the issue, which is often temporary. You can try generating for that person again later.
