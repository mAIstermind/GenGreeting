    <h1>LLM-Assisted Deployment Guide for GenGreeting</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      This guide is designed to help you use a Large Language Model (LLM) like ChatGPT, Gemini, or Claude as your personal assistant to deploy the GenGreeting application. Instead of providing direct instructions, this document gives you the exact questions and prompts to ask the LLM at each stage of the process.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Your Overall Goal:</strong> To deploy a live, working version of the GenGreeting application on the internet, which you can customize and link to your own marketing funnels.
    </p>
    <h2>Phase 1: Understanding the Prerequisites</h2>
    <p>
      Ask your LLM the following questions to make sure you have everything you need before you start.
    </p>
    <h3>Prompt 1:</h3>
    <pre><code>I need to deploy a web application called GenGreeting. The documentation says I need a 'Google Gemini API Key' and a 'static website hosting provider'.

What is a Google Gemini API Key and can you give me a link to where I can get one?

What is a 'static website hosting provider'?

Please recommend a few free and easy-to-use providers. I've heard of Vercel, Netlify, and Render. Can you compare them for a simple project like this?
</code></pre>
    <h3>Prompt 2:</h3>
    <p>
      Do I need a GitHub account to deploy this application on a provider like Vercel or Netlify? If so, why is it recommended?
    </p>

    <h2>Phase 2: Preparing Your Code</h2>
    <p>
      Now, let's get the application code organized in a GitHub repository.
    </p>
    <h3>Prompt 3:</h3>
    <pre><code>I have the source code for the GenGreeting application in a folder on my computer. I need to get this code into a new GitHub repository. Please provide me with the exact git commands to:

1. Initialize a new git repository in my code folder.
2. Add all the files.
3. Make an initial commit.
4. Create a new public repository on GitHub named 'gengreeting-app' (you don't need to do this for me, just tell me how to find the URL for the next step).
5. Link my local repository to the new remote GitHub repository.
6. Push my code to GitHub.
</code></pre>

    <h2>Phase 3: Deploying the Application</h2>
    <p>
      With your code on GitHub, you're ready to deploy it to the web.
    </p>
    <h3>Prompt 4:</h3>
    <pre><code>I have pushed my GenGreeting application code to a GitHub repository. I've decided to use [Choose one: Vercel or Netlify]. Please give me a clear, step-by-step guide on how to deploy my app from GitHub to this provider. Since this is a simple static app with no build step, please make sure the instructions reflect that. (The LLM's response should guide you through signing up, connecting GitHub, importing your repo, and clicking deploy. It should mention that the default settings are likely fine).
</code></pre>

    <h2>Phase 4: Handling the API Key (Crucial Step)</h2>
    <p>
      This is the most critical and complex part. The application code is set up to use an API key from <code>process.env.API_KEY</code>, which won't work directly on a static site. You will need the LLM's help to modify the code.
    </p>
    <h3>Prompt 5 (The Simple, Insecure Method for Testing ONLY):</h3>
    <pre><code>The application file <code>services/geminiService.ts</code> gets the API key using <code>const API_KEY = process.env.API_KEY;</code>. I understand this won't work when I deploy it as a static site.

For testing purposes only, please show me how to modify this file to temporarily hardcode my API key directly into the code. Please include a big, clear warning about why this is insecure and should not be used in production.
</code></pre>
    <h3>Prompt 6 (The Secure, Recommended Method):</h3>
    <pre><code>I want to handle my Gemini API key securely. My hosting provider, [Your Chosen Provider: Vercel or Netlify], supports serverless functions.

Please provide a two-part guide:
1. Backend: A step-by-step guide to create a new serverless function within my project. This function should act as a secure proxy. It will receive a request from my frontend, call the Gemini API using my secret API key (which I will set as a secure environment variable), and then return the Gemini API's response back to the frontend.

2. Frontend: Show me the necessary modifications for the services/geminiService.ts file. I need to change the functions (like generateGreetingCardImage) to call my new serverless function endpoint instead of calling the Gemini API directly.
</code></pre>

    <h2>Phase 5: Whitelabeling Your App</h2>
    <p>
      Now that the app is live, let's rebrand it.
    </p>
    <h3>Prompt 7:</h3>
    <pre><code>I want to change the name of my deployed GenGreeting app.
1. Which file do I need to edit?
2. What specific lines inside that file should I change to rebrand the app? Let's say I want the new name to be 'AI Greetings'. Show me the exact code I should use.
3. After I make and save this change locally, what are the git commands to push this update so it appears on my live website?
</code></pre>

    <h2>Phase 6: GoHighLevel (GHL) Funnel Integration</h2>
    <p>
      Finally, let's set up the marketing pages.
    </p>
    <h3>Prompt 8:</h3>
    <pre><code>I have three HTML files: <code>ghl-landing-page.html</code>, <code>ghl-pricing-page.html</code>, and <code>ghl-thank-you-page.html</code>. I need to import these into a new GoHighLevel Funnel. Can you give me a general guide on how to import custom HTML into a GHL funnel page?
</code></pre>
    <h3>Prompt 9:</h3>
    <pre><code>In my <code>ghl-thank-you-page.html</code> file, there is a button with the text 'Go to the App'. I need to link this button to my live, deployed application. Where do I find the public URL for my app on [Your Chosen Provider: Vercel or Netlify]?
