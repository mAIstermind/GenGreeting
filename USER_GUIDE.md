## 3. Getting Started: A Step-by-Step Guide

The application has two main tabs for generating images. Let's explore both.

### 3.1. Generating Cards in Bulk ("Batch Generate via CSV")

This is the perfect tool for creating personalized cards for your entire contact list at once.

**Step 1: Prepare Your CSV File**
Create a CSV file with at least two columns: one for names and one for emails. You can also include other columns for more detailed personalization, like "Job Title", "Hobby", or "City".

**Step 2: Upload Your File**
On the "Batch Generate via CSV" tab, click the upload area or drag-and-drop your prepared CSV file into it.

**Step 3: Map Your Columns**
The app will ask you to confirm which column contains the names and which contains the emails.
*   Under **Contact Name**, select the column from your file that holds the names.
*   Under **Contact Email**, select the column for email addresses.

**Step 4 (Optional): Add Theme Customization**
Below the Name and Email mapping, you'll see a field for **"Theme Customization"**. This is a powerful feature that allows you to select another column from your CSV to add extra detail to each card.
*   **Example:** If your CSV has a column named "Hobby", and for John Doe the value is "hiking", the AI will add "hiking" to the prompt for John's card, creating a more personalized image. Simply select your "Hobby" column from the dropdown.

**Step 5: Choose a Style with Visual Previews**
Instead of just a list of names, you'll see a grid of thumbnails, each representing a different visual theme.
*   Click on a thumbnail to select the style you want.
*   You can see a text preview of the prompt below the grid to understand how the AI will interpret the style.

**Step 6: Generate & Download**
Click **"Confirm & Proceed"**. The application will begin generating a unique card for each person in your list. Once finished, you can:
*   Download cards one by one using the "Download" button on each card.
*   **(Pro Feature)** Click **"Download All (.zip)"** to save all cards, with your branding applied, in a single file.

### 3.2. Generating a Single Image ("Generate with Imagen")

Use this tab when you only need one high-quality image.

**Step 1: Write Your Prompt**
In the text box, describe the image you want to create. Be as descriptive as possible! For example: *"A photorealistic image of a golden retriever wearing sunglasses on a beach."*

**Step 2: Generate**
Click the **"Generate"** button. The AI will create your image and display it below.

### 3.3. Editing Your Cards

After generating a card, you can fine-tune it.

1.  Hover over any card image and click the **"Edit"** button.
2.  A new window will appear. In the text box, type your edit instruction (e.g., *"Make the background blue"* or *"Add a Santa hat"*).
3.  Click **"Apply Edit"** to see the changes. You can apply multiple edits.
4.  Once you're happy, click **"Save Changes"**.

### 3.4. Managing Your Account & Subscription

**Free Trial:** New users can generate up to 10 cards for free. The number of remaining generations is shown when you open the app.

**Pro Accounts:**
*   **Credit Tracking:** If you have a paid plan, your remaining monthly credits are shown in the header (e.g., "485 / 500 credits left"). This counter resets automatically every month.
*   **Upgrading:** You can click the "Upgrade" button in the header at any time to go to the pricing page and choose a different plan.
*   **Custom Branding:** Click the **user icon** in the top-right corner to open Settings. Here you can enter your name/business name and upload a logo. Your branding will be automatically applied to the corner of every card when you use the **"Download All (.zip)"** function.

## 4. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Q: What happens if I run out of credits?**
A: The generation features will be disabled. You will see a message prompting you to upgrade your plan to continue creating cards.

**Q: What happens if an image fails to generate for one of my contacts?**
A: The app will stop the batch process and display an error message explaining the issue. This prevents you from wasting credits on a faulty list or temporary API issue. You can then fix the issue and try again.

**Q: Can I use my own custom prompts for batch generation?**
A: Currently, batch generation uses the provided templates for consistency and quality, but you can add custom details using the "Theme Customization" feature. For fully custom one-off prompts, please use the "Generate with Imagen" tab.
