**Feature 1: Batch Generate via CSV**
This is the perfect tool for creating personalized cards for your entire contact list at once.

**Step 1: Prepare Your CSV File**
Your CSV file must contain a column for names. Other columns, such as 'email', will be ignored by the application.

*   **Required Name Column:** A column with a header like `name` or `Full Name`. You will select this column in the next step.
*   **Optional Image Column:** A column with a header like `profileImageUrl` containing a full, publicly accessible URL to a JPG, PNG, or WEBP image. The AI will cleverly incorporate this image into the final design.

**Image URL Guidelines (Important):**
*   The URL must link **directly** to the image file (e.g., ending in `.jpg`, `.png`).
*   The image must be **publicly accessible** (not behind a login).
*   The image file size should be under **4MB**.
*   For best results, use **square** images (e.g., 500x500 pixels).

**Step 2: Upload Your File**
On the "Batch Generate via CSV" tab, click the upload area or drag-and-drop your prepared CSV file into it.

**Step 3: Map Your Columns**
The app will ask you to confirm which column from your file to use.
*   Under **Contact Name**, select the column that holds the names.
*   Under **Profile/Logo Image URL**, optionally select the column that contains your direct image links.

**Step 4: Choose a Style with Visual Previews**
Click on a thumbnail to select the visual theme you want for all the cards in your batch.

**Step 5: Generate & Download**
Click **"Confirm & Proceed"**. Once finished, you can:
*   Download cards one by one using the "Download" button.
*   **(Subscribed Feature)** Click **"Download All (.zip)"** to save all cards, with your custom branding applied, in a single file.
